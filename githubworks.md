## How Does Github/Terminal work?

# Download a file from github  
"git checkout master" - if using project on multiple devices  
"git pull" - make sure your branch is most up to date  
"git chcekout" - checkout working branch  
"git pull" - Make sure this branch is up to date  
"git rebase master" - upadate your branch from the master  
Good to go!

# Add files to Repository  
"git add ." - stage your changes  
"git commit -m 'message goes here'" - commit changes and leave a message for later refernce  
"git push" - push the data up to github
